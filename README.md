# DataStructures (All implementations are based on Coursera Algorithims and Data Structures course)

Custom implementations of various kinds of data structures like Stack,Queue,Map etc.

Queue implementations by using two stacks ,
Stack implementation by using array.



Dequeue = A double-ended queue or deque (pronounced â€œdeckâ€�) is a generalization of a stack and a queue that supports adding and removing items from either the front or the back of the data structure. Create a generic data type Deque that implements the following API:


Randomized queue = A randomized queue is similar to a stack or queue, except that the item removed is chosen uniformly at random from items in the data structure. Create a generic data type RandomizedQueue that implements the following API:


Merge Sort implementation.

Merging two sorted arrays into one array via an aux array.
